# Spontaneous_imbibition_analysis
 
This repository is split into two directories. The first directory titled 'experimental_analysis' contains the Matlab codes for analyzing the PET and CT data, performing spatial moment analysis, and calculating overall imbibition rate. The second directory contains the Python codes used for generating the TOUGH2 models via [PyTOUGH](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH).
Finally the colorscales are generated with colorbrewer: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab
