# Spontaneous_imbibition_analysis
 
This repository is split into two directories. The first directory titled 'experimental_analysis' contains the Matlab codes for analyzing the PET and CT data, performing spatial moment analysis, and calculating overall imbibition rate. These were used to generate Figure 1 and Figure 2. Accurate colormap generation in the Matlab requires the [Colorbrewer functions](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab). The second directory contains the Python codes used for generating the [TOUGH2/EOS3](https://tough.lbl.gov/) models via [PyTOUGH](https://github.com/acroucher/PyTOUGH). The file ['SI_model_generation_2D_2phase.py'](https://github.com/zahasky/spontaneous_imbibition_analysis/blob/master/TOUGH2_models/SI_model_generation_2D_2phase.py) was used to generate the TOUGH2 model input file ['horiz2D_cap_het.dat'](https://github.com/zahasky/spontaneous_imbibition_analysis/blob/master/TOUGH2_models/horiz2D_cap_het.dat). The Python script ['pytough_imbibe_plots.py'](https://github.com/zahasky/spontaneous_imbibition_analysis/blob/master/TOUGH2_models/pytough_imbibe_plots.py) was used to generate Figure 3 and Figure 4. The second repository also contains the script ['grid_refinement_1D_EOS3.py'](https://github.com/zahasky/spontaneous_imbibition_analysis/blob/master/TOUGH2_models/grid_refinement_1D_EOS3.py) used to perform the grid refinement study in the appendix.
