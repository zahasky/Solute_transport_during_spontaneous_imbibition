Note that the modeling requires the installation of the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox: https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/download/
Scripts for plotting the x-ray CT and PET data utilizes the PATCH3D function available on the Matlab file exchanger here: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28497-plot-a-3d-array-using-patch
Finally the colorscales are generated with colorbrewer: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab
